# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## üìå Overview
This project implements a binary classification model to predict whether breast cancer tumors are **malignant (M)** or **benign (B)** using the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset**.  
The model is built using **Logistic Regression in Python**, with steps including:
- Data investigation  
- Visualization  
- Preprocessing  
- Training  
- Evaluation  
- Interpretation  

The goal is to achieve high accuracy while **minimizing false negatives**, which are critical in medical diagnostics.

## üìä Dataset
The project uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data).  

- **Records:** 569  
- **Features:** 30 numerical features (e.g., `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `perimeter_mean`, etc.) describing cell nuclei characteristics  
- **Target:** Diagnosis (`M = Malignant`, `B = Benign`)  
- Data is loaded directly from the UCI URL in the notebook.
